# 300ShackGameJam

This is all the source files to my entry for the 2017 Shacknews Game Jam. 

Note: This originally used the Next Gen Soft Shadows asset, however as this is a paid asset its been removed though there might be a script or two attached to the lights that will show as missing, just remove it and everything will be fine.
